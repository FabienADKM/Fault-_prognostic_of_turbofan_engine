# Fault prognostic of turbofan engine
Deep Learning project which aims to predict the RUL of a turbofan engine

# Pre-requisites
The `requirements.txt` file should intsall all Python libraries that the project 
depends on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Notes
 To run the project executes the file 'main.py' it will plot the predicted RUL curves after
 training a Neural networks on the Kaggle datastet contained in the CMAPSSData folder. 
 
 N.B : The data are firstly pre-processed with a Principal Components Analysis in order to reduce the 
 dimensionality of the problem.
